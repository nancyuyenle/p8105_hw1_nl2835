```{r}
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

The "early_january_weather dataset describes hourly meteorological data for LGA, JFK, and EWR for the month of January 2013. This is a subset of the weather data frame from nycflights13. 

The format of this dataset is a dataframe of ``r nrow(early_january_weather)`` rows and ``r ncol(early_january_weather)`` columns representing hourly measurements and 15 variables. Some important variables are origin (meaning the weather station), year, month, day, hour, temp, and dewp. 

```{r}
mean_temp <- mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

The mean temperature is ``r mean_temp``.



```{r yx_scatter}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = early_january_weather, aes(x = hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```
