data("early_january_weather")
?early_january_weather
```

The "early_january_weather dataset describes hourly meterological data for LGA, JFK, and EWR for the month of January 2013. This is a subset of the weather data frame from nycflights13. 

The format of this dataset is a dataframe of ``r nrow(early_january_weather)`` rows and ``r ncol(early_january_weather)`` columns representing hourly measurements and 15 variables. Some important variables are origin (meaning the weather station), year, month, day, hour, temp, and dewp.
